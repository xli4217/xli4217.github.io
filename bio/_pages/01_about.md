I am currently a Ph.D candidate at Boston University working with Prof. Calin Belta in the BU Robotics Lab. I use techniques in formal methods to make reinforcement learning more applicable in robotic systems. This includes improving the expressiveness and accuracy of rewards, promoting skill transferrability among tasks, increasing learning efficiency via spatio-temporal abstractions, etc. I received my M.S. at Johns Hopkins University and B.S. at the University of British Columbia.
